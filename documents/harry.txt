Patient Symptom Journal: Left Shoulder Pain

Day 1

I am a 29-year-old male, 188 cm tall and weighing 82 kg. I work in an office job and I engage in daily strength training. For the past few weeks, I have started noticing discomfort in my left shoulder. The pain is located mainly around the front of the shoulder and the acromion. Initially, it was a dull ache but now sometimes it feels sharp when I perform certain movements. Pull-ups and push-ups are particularly challenging.

The pain intensity fluctuates throughout the day. In the morning, the shoulder feels stiff and slightly sore. By midday, after typing or performing routine tasks, I notice a dull, nagging pain that can sometimes become a sharp twinge when reaching overhead. At night, lying on the left side worsens the sensation, causing a burning discomfort that occasionally wakes me from sleep. Dressing and washing my hair are also activities that elicit discomfort.

I have noticed a subtle popping sound when I rotate my shoulder externally. It is not painful, but it is noticeable. The left biceps feels weaker compared to the right during curls and straight-arm presses. I performed a weighted curl yesterday, and the contraction felt much less intense in the left arm than in the right.

Rehabilitation exercises today included wall slides, YTW movements, scap push-ups, and external rotations. During wall slides, I felt my scapular muscles engage, but the left side was weaker and less responsive. During YTW exercises, the left shoulder felt tight at the bottom of the movement. Scap push-ups produced mild discomfort, but I completed all sets with care. External rotations slightly improved my sensation of stability, though the left shoulder still lagged behind in activation.

Day 2

This morning, my left shoulder was still sore but slightly less stiff. Performing simple movements such as reaching for my coffee cup triggered mild discomfort. I noticed a faint popping sound when performing external rotation, similar to yesterday. The biceps contraction during a straight-arm press was still weaker on the left, though marginally improved.

During pull-ups, the shoulder popped lightly as I bent my elbows to initiate the movement. I tried to control elbow adduction to minimize the sensation. Weighted pull-downs revealed that the left side is underperforming compared to the right, requiring me to focus on posture and control.

Rehab exercises were repeated: wall slides, YTW, scap push-ups, and external rotation. Wall slides showed slight improvements in scapular control. YTW movements produced a minor ache in the trapezius. Scap push-ups were completed with careful attention to form. External rotations felt marginally better. I continue to notice the imbalance in activation between left and right muscles.

Day 3

The left shoulder was noticeably tender today. Morning stiffness persists. While typing, I noticed the shoulder fatigue after about one hour of continuous work. Reaching overhead to retrieve items from a shelf triggered a dull ache. Popping was audible during external rotation, still painless. Biceps contraction remains weaker on the left.

I attempted a push-up session. During the lowering phase, the shoulder produced a subtle pop. I consciously controlled the movement, focusing on proper alignment. Wall slides showed incremental improvement, with slightly better activation of the scapular muscles. YTW movements caused mild fatigue, indicating that the muscles are being recruited. Scap push-ups were manageable, though the left shoulder continues to feel less stable than the right. External rotation exercises again produced minor relief in terms of stability.

Day 4

The morning stiffness continues, though pain intensity during rest decreased slightly. The shoulder pops intermittently with movement. Biceps contraction is weak on the left but slightly better than two days ago. Push-ups remain challenging, particularly in the final few repetitions where fatigue magnifies the imbalance between sides.

Rehab exercises included wall slides, YTW, scap push-ups, and external rotations. Wall slides showed modest gains in scapular activation. YTW exercises felt slightly easier, though still challenging on the left side. Scap push-ups were completed without sharp discomfort. External rotations slightly improved perceived shoulder stability.

Daily tasks such as dressing and lifting objects remain mildly painful. Reaching overhead triggers mild discomfort. Typing and sitting for extended periods contribute to minor stiffness. Psychological concern arises due to the recurring nature of the discomfort.

Day 5

I notice a small improvement in shoulder mobility, though tenderness persists. Morning stiffness is less pronounced. Shoulder pops are still present during rotational movements. Biceps contraction on the left continues to be weaker than on the right during curls and presses. Weighted exercises emphasize the asymmetry, requiring careful attention.

Rehabilitation exercises repeated. Wall slides, YTW, scap push-ups, and external rotations show gradual improvement. Scapular control seems slightly better on the left side. YTW exercises feel less strenuous, though still more challenging than the right side. Scap push-ups are manageable with moderate fatigue. External rotation exercises provide slight stability.

Daily activities such as pushing doors, reaching overhead, and dressing cause intermittent discomfort. Pain is mild but noticeable. Psychological awareness of the injury persists, emphasizing careful monitoring and rehabilitation focus.
