The patient is a 20-year-old male college student who presented to the university health clinic with complaints of persistent cough, intermittent low-grade fever, and fatigue over the past 10 days. He reported that his symptoms began with a sore throat and nasal congestion, which progressed to a productive cough with yellowish sputum. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or weight loss. He has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical exam was notable for mild pharyngeal erythema, post-nasal drip, and coarse breath sounds in the right lower lobe. A chest X-ray was performed and showed evidence of a localized right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. He was diagnosed with uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia and prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin, with instructions for supportive care and hydration. He was advised to monitor for signs of worsening symptoms, such as high fever, pleuritic chest pain, or difficulty breathing. Follow-up was scheduled in one week to assess clinical improvement. The patient was educated on medication adherence, rest, and nutrition to support recovery. He expressed understanding of his diagnosis and was cooperative throughout the visit.
