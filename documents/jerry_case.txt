The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath, bilateral lower extremity swelling, and fatigue over the past two weeks. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 168/94 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Physical examination noted bibasilar crackles, jugular venous distention, and 2+ pitting edema in both legs. A chest X-ray demonstrated pulmonary vascular congestion and cardiomegaly, while an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35%. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated BNP, mild troponin leak, and serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. She was admitted to the cardiology service and started on intravenous diuretics and low-dose beta-blockers. Throughout her hospital stay, her urine output improved and dyspnea gradually resolved. However, glycemic control remained suboptimal, with glucose levels frequently above 250 mg/dL. Endocrinology was consulted, and insulin therapy was initiated. Social history reveals that the patient lives alone and reports difficulty adhering to low-sodium and diabetic diets due to financial constraints. A nutritionist and case manager were involved to assist with dietary planning and outpatient follow-up. By hospital day six, her symptoms had stabilized, and discharge planning was initiated. The final diagnosis included acute decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes, and renal insufficiency. The patient was discharged home with close cardiology and nephrology follow-up, home health nursing, and heart failure education materials.
